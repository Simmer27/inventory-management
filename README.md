# Inventory Management System

This project is an inventory management system for a childcare facility. The project uses a MERN stack consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Current features are a user can securley log into the site and see the current inventory. The user can add a new item and delete existing items. Items are added and deleted in real time. Users can edit and request items. Each room has its dedicated page.

To run this program, start by opening the backend folder in the terminal and typing npm run dev to start up the backend. Next, open the frontend folder in the terminal and type npm start to launch the React app.

Currently, the backend is running on Render, and the frontend is running on Netlify, so the project won't be able to run locally without changing the URLs in the code.
